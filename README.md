# **Transcribe-It**

### **Automated Transcription for Audio Files**

## **üìñ Overview**
**Transcribe-It** is a Python-based audio transcription tool designed for **automatically converting speech into text**. 
I initially wrote the script to transcribe **assignment audio files** for a **German course** in **NPTEL** (as a*3rd-year compulsory subject*). 

Understanding the spoken content in these recordings was challenging for me, so I created this tool to streamline the process. 

## **‚öôÔ∏è How It Works**
- The script **converts MP3 audio files** into **WAV (Waveform Audio Format)** and stores them in a temporary directory: 

- It then processes these WAV files and **extracts text** using **Google Speech Recognition**.  
- The transcriptions are **saved as `.txt` files**, named according to the corresponding audio file.  
- Users can specify the **language of the audio file**, and the script automatically maps it to the correct language code.
